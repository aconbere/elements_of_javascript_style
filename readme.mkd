# Elements of JavaScript Style #


We start with the assertion that there is a great language inside of JavaScript. But that many people struggle to find their way to it. The most common resources for learning were written in the dark ages of the web, and advocate a style and structure that is non-conducive to quality, readable, and performant code. In particular there is a lack of discussion regarding how best to approach and organize a large sized JavaScript application. 

This is an evolving document, one that I hope the JavaScript community finds useful, In it I'm trying to collect best practices, patterns and styles, into a larger and comprehensive document about how best to tackle writing JavaScript applications.
